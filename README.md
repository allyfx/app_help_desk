<h1>HELP DESK</h1>

<p>The Help Desk is an application that allows you to add new complaints and view all the complaints you've made before. 
It is very simple to use and does not have many features.</p>
<p>You can use an administrative email that is specified in the emails already registered, or you can use one of the emails from registered users. If you're a user you can see your calls, if you're an administrator you can see all calls already made.</p>
